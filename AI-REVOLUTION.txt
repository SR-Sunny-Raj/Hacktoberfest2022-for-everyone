We are in the midst of an artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. It is transforming our lives and societies in ways we cannot even imagine. And yet, many of us are still resistant to embracing it.

But AI is so much more than that. It is a technology that is going to change every aspect of our lives, from the way we work and play, to the way we interact with each other and the world around us.
